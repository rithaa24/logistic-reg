#Ad Sale Prediction Using Logistic Regression
#Overview
This project aims to predict ad sales based on various features using logistic regression. The dataset contains information on past ad campaigns, and the goal is to predict whether an ad will result in a sale or not.

#Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
ad_sales.csv: The main dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model development.
data_preprocessing.ipynb: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
model_training.ipynb: Model training and evaluation using logistic regression.
src/: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
data_preprocessing.py: Script to clean and preprocess the data.
train_model.py: Script to train the logistic regression model.
predict.py: Script to make predictions using the trained model.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
models/: Folder to store trained models.
#Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset ad_sales.csv contains the following columns:

Ad ID: Unique identifier for each ad.
Ad Budget: The budget allocated for the ad.
Platform: The platform where the ad was displayed (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Clicks: The number of clicks the ad received.
Impressions: The number of times the ad was shown.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of clicks that resulted in sales.
Sale: Binary target variable indicating whether the ad led to a sale (1) or not (0).
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing includes:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing/standardizing numerical features.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Run the data_preprocessing.py script or refer to the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook for detailed steps.

Model Training
The model is trained using logistic regression. The train_model.py script or model_training.ipynb notebook contains the code for training the model.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix is also plotted to visualize the results.

Prediction
To make predictions on new data, use the predict.py script. Ensure that the model is already trained and saved in the models/ directory.

Usage
Preprocess the Data:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the Model:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
Make Predictions:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --input new_ad_data.csv --output predictions.csv
Results
The logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. The detailed performance metrics are provided in the model_training.ipynb notebook.

Conclusion
Logistic regression provides a simple yet effective way to predict ad sales based on historical data. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different feature engineering techniques or using more advanced models.
